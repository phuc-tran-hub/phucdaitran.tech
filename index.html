<h1>
    The Journal of My Disciplines Starts Today with this Website!
</h1>

<p> 
    I have always neglected on developing my own website, but after reading the <span style="color:violet">Second Brain </span>, 
    I realized that this is an opportunity for me to journal everything that I have learned in my gap year. I have gotten a lot of knowledge
    from my shower thoughts and mentors, and now is the time to digest and manifest my new understandings.

<h2> Reorganize Your Thoughts </h2>
<p> Use a single Notes app to jot down all your emotions and daydreams. Be conscious of your progress. </p>

<h2> Become Present with Your Senses </h2>
<p> Do not multi-task. Be aware of what your eyes see with your ears and noses. </p>

<h2> Absorb Knowledge into Wisdom </h2>
<p> It is difficult to know what advices work for you. Listen with your heart but also trust your instincts. </p>
