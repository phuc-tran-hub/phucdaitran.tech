    <!-- <p> 
        I have always neglected on developing my own website, but after reading the <span style="color:violet">Second Brain </span>, 
        I realized that this is an opportunity for me to journal everything that I have learned in my gap year. I have gotten a lot of knowledge
        from my shower thoughts and mentors, and now is the time to digest and manifest my new understandings. Currently I am focused on: 
        
            <ul>
                <li> Working Out </li>
                <li> Breaking </li>
                <li> Sleeping </li>
                <li> Researching </li>
                <li> Studying </li>
                <li> Relaxing </li>
            </ul>
        </div>  

        After actively journaling my processes, I became much more aware of my progress and became proud of my business! I had always thought I was a lazy person 
        until I was able to materialize my spiral thoughts into one medium. As I am progressing in my life, I hope to also see that same progress in my Full-Stack development skills
        By the end of 2024, I wish to be both wide and deep in my knowledge from robotics programming to low level parallel computing to full-stack development :)
